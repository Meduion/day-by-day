# Day by Day

## Description

A simple browser based scheduler that saves input to local storage and keeps it available upon refresh. I learned a lot of different ways of using Jquery in making this project, mostly by researching the Jquery documentation. Also discovered a way to pull from the local storage by matching IDs to the keys of the storage items though it took a lot of trial and error.

Used a stackoverflow reply from Mike H. to construct the function that changes block colors, found at this address:

Classmate Jarrett Butler helped me with using the IDs of the time blocks and using them as the key for the key value pair in the local storage.
